"""These routines are for doing typical extracellular (cell-attached) analyses.

The main data structures we use here are XSG dictionaries.  These
contain keys by default that have a collection of meta-data, and one
key for each of the three ephus programs (ephys, acquierer and
stimulator).

We have been inspired by the spike_sort package, but re-implemented
routines to better fit the XSG data structure.  In particular, we have
'detectSpikes' and 'extractSpikes', as well as routines to calculate
spike rate histograms and densities, and plotting a spike raster.
